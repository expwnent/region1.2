Year one! There's magma being poured into the trenches below; once the
channels are dug, SEAL OFF THE CHANNEL ACCESS FOREVER. The lever near
the hatch cover is to be pulled as soon as the trenches are filled
- since the magma is never used up, pull it ONLY WHEN EVERYTHING IS 7/7
AND THE HATCH IS COVERED IN 7/7 WATER, FOR THE LOVE OF FPS. Seal off
the belowground grazing areas and expand them. No one comes in or out
except through the front entrance. The front entrance has some holes
- seal those, too.
