Reinders, fourth year of the fortress
Granite 1: After a year of mediocrity, followed by a bloody rout of our builders, I took receipt of the fortress. Bodies litter the surface. Goblin squads made short work of the military and civilians. No warning bell was rung. It's a massacre, a tragedy rarely seen in this scale. The goblins will pay. But I'm not going out there. No, fuck that, we're staying down here, behind our wall of traps, until those goblins disappear and we might have a chance.

We need towers. Crossbow towers. But I fear this ice is going to melt before we get the chance, and I don't know what we'll do then. I'm not organizing an aquifer punch. No, no, no. Just not going to happen.

Our whole farm organization is insane. Basically, we don't have one at all. We have no textile industry at all - not sure how anyone expects to get anything done without bags. Bags - one in every room.

Did I mention the surface? It's a horror movie. The corpses of soldiers, indicated only by the shiny metal badges they'd pulled out and pinned to their worn clothing, strew the outer entrance. Just let the goblins hit the traps! That's what they're there for. But no, no, now we have corpses.

And no rail system exists in here. I need to build one. I don't know the first thing about physics, but I know design, so I'm not going to build automation - leave that for whoever fucks up the lives of hundreds when I'm gone. My goal, pure and simple, is to see us through tomorrow.

Granite 6: Some idiot decided to make armor out of gold.

Granite 12: BARONY, BITCHES! Aw, man, after that disaster, I thought our fortress was doomed. Of course, the loser who killed thirty dwarves gets it - maybe I should just kill him off. Oh, but murder is baaaaaaaad. It's punishable seveeeeeerely. God, I sound like my mother.

But I'm still in fucking charge, so suck it, Retard Leader.

Granite 14: AGH, FUCK. FUCK FUCKITY FUCK FUCK I'M GOING TO PUNCH SOMETHING. WHAT IS THIS FUCKING FORTRESS FUCK I HATE EVERYTHING

21st Granite: Actually made the outside a wall - well, part of it. There are still goblins to the north, but they're too stupid to rush the fortress and get chewed apart by the weapons traps. I apologize, my precious notebook, for the rage a week ago. I was having a really shitty day. The left south side of the map is totally sealed off, now - except for one wall well away from a goblin crossbowman with no bolts stuck in a pit, which still manages to fuck up every job that occurs anywhere in the fortress. Dwarves, he's for taunting, not for cowering in fear from. Remedied by restricting the viewing area, so only idiots with something to prove will walk up.
